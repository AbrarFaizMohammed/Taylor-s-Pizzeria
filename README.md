# Taylor-s-Pizzeria
The application being developed for the current Java project is intended to communicate with a MySQL database. Depending on the user's chosen menu options, the application is capable of carrying out a variety of database activities. The main goal of the project is to make it easier for Taylor's Pizzeria to take pizza orders.


The first step after cloning the repository is to configure the database. You must run each script found in the "Application Database Setup" folder of your MySQL database in order to accomplish this. By doing this, you can be sure that the database is set up correctly and prepared for use by the program.

You can upload the application code into any Java code editor of your choice when the database has been set up. Depending on your unique requirements, this will allow you to make any adjustments or tweaks to the code that are required.

Making sure that your code editor is set up correctly to interface with the MySQL database is crucial. To accomplish this, add the jar file to the library in your code editor. As a result, all database actions will be successfully carried out because the Java code will be able to communicate with the database in an effortless manner.
